Project Overview: Bengaluru House Price Prediction
This project focuses on predicting house prices in Bengaluru using machine learning techniques. It involves analyzing and processing a dataset of house features to develop a predictive model. The key steps in the project are as follows:

Data Loading and Inspection:
The dataset containing information about Bengaluru houses was loaded and inspected to understand its structure, identify missing values, and assess data quality.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Missing values were handled by dropping or imputing them based on relevance.
Rare categories in features like location were grouped into a single "other" category to reduce dimensionality.
The availability feature was transformed into quarterly groups for simplification.
Features like size were split into numerical and categorical components.
Outliers in total_sqft and size_num were detected and removed using the IQR method to ensure data consistency.
Feature Engineering:

One-hot encoding was applied to categorical features (location, size_category, availability, and area_type) to make them suitable for machine learning models.
Numerical features, such as size_num and total_sqft, were scaled and cleaned for uniformity.
Model Development:

The cleaned dataset was split into training and testing sets.
A Linear Regression model was trained on the training data to predict house prices.
Model performance was evaluated using metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
Results and Insights:

The RMSE was calculated to measure the accuracy of predictions.
A final accuracy of the model was determined, reflecting its effectiveness in predicting house prices.
Applications:
This model can assist homebuyers, real estate agents, and developers in estimating house prices in Bengaluru, thereby facilitating informed decision-making.
